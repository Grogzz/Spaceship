# Spaceship
An 'Asteroid' clone made in C++ with SFML 2.4.2

That's the first game I make.
I try to clone something simple and well-known.
No fancy animations, effects or sounds.
No complicated physics or mathematics.
Something to improve my skills.

I still have a lot to learn from the datastructures, the design patterns used in videogames and C++ itself.
